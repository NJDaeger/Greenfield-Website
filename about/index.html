			<h1>About Us</h1>
			<hr>
			<p style="--animation-order: 1;">
				Greenfield is a city like no other. We are built to the finest detail, but also carefully planned on a large scale.
				We have designed the city on a 1:1 scale, which means 1 block is equivalent to 1 meter- this scale allows us to create
				the feeling you are walking in a real city relative to the size of the Steve character. While we may only be 20%
				complete with the city, we are arguably one of the most complete and detailed cities which currently exists in Minecraft.
				With thousands of unique builds and 99% of all buildings having a full interior, there's nearly an endless stream of
				opportunities for exploration and easter eggs.
			</p>
			<hr>
			<p style="--animation-order: 2;">
				We are a fictional city which is based on the west coast, and heavily inspired by Los Angeles. Starting back in August
				of 2011 by THEJESTR, Greenfield has been continuously worked on to this day to bring new areas of exploration, an
				increasing quality standard of building, and an increasing amount of accuracy to California. The types of builds you
				will find in Greenfield are the same buildings you would find in a real life city on the west coast. There is a Downtown
				which has many large skyscrapers (all completed interiors), rich suburbs, poor decaying ghettos, industrial areas, as
				well as a vast network of roads, interstates, and highways.
