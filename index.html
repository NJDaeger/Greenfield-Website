			<h1>About Greenfield</h1>
			<p>Greenfield City began in 2011 by a Minecraft player named THEJESTR. When he made the original posting
				for the server on <a href="https://www.planetminecraft.com/project/greenfield---new-life-size-city-project/">PlanetMinecraft</a>, 
				he soon got a following of several active members. The map finally bengan to take off and over time, slowly grew to the 
				2,000,000+ views and nearly 1 million downloads of the map we have today. The offical server has over 450 members who are
				whitelisted, and has been in continuous development since the beginning.</p>

			<h1>Our Goal</h1>
			<p>Our goal is to completely fill the map we have created for ourselves. Until recently, our goal was undecided- we didn't know how far
				we wanted to go before we considered our map complete. In a development over several months, and lots of Google Maps research, we
				have finally decided on a size, and a geographic idea of what we wanted our final map to look like. This final map is 15,000x13,000
				blocks, and we have started proposing final road network plans.</p>
